Hey there! 👋 I'm Craig Wilkinson 
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate software engineer with over 10 years of experience in SQL Server and the .NET ecosystem.

🌟 About Me
I love diving into data, solving complex problems, and learning new things. My coding journey is rooted in my enthusiasm for transforming ideas into actionable solutions. Whether it's crafting high-performance database designs or automating repetitive tasks, I always aim to create tools that make life easier and more efficient.

💡 Why I Code
For me, coding isn’t just a profession—it’s a playground for creativity. From automating daily tasks to optimising workflows, I’m constantly looking for ways to simplify the complex and make the mundane magical.

🏃‍♂️ Outside the Terminal
When I’m not coding, you can find me running or spending time with my family. I’m a keen runner, and I enjoy the clarity it brings—whether I’m pacing through my local park or cheering my son on at junior parkruns.
