I'm Craig Wilkinson, a UK-based Senior Software Engineer with over a decade of experience delivering high-performance, data-driven systems. My background is rooted in the Microsoft stack, with a strong focus on SQL Server and C#. I've led the design and implementation of reporting platforms, data pipelines, and automation tooling across a range of business-critical environments.

SQL Server remains my core expertise, but in recent years I've also worked with Redshift and PostgreSQL, adapting to cloud-first architectures and large-scale data processing. I'm comfortable getting deep into query tuning, schema design, and backend servicesâ€”especially when there's a gnarly data problem to unravel.

This GitHub contains a mix of exploratory side projects and tools I've built to scratch my own itches. Expect some rough edges.

When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me:
- Running marathons (I've got the tattoos to prove it)
- Playing games with my son
- Drinking whisky and planning blog posts I may or may not write
